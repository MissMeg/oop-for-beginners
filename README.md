# Object Oriented Python for Beginners

This repo is both a small guide to learn object oriented programming with Python and a way for me to better understand OOP myself. Teaching something really shows how well you know a subject, so this is my way of testing my knowledge, filling in my gaps, and helping anyone who wants to learn OOP. The style of this guide is to create simple examples and to walk you through the code as much as possible.

## Sections

This guide is broken up into multiple sections:

- [Beginner_OOP](https://github.com/MissMeg/oop-practice/tree/master/Beginner_OOP) - This is a great place to start if you have no knowledge of OOP. This will start at the beginning and go through some simple examples. You will need to know the basics of Python.
- [Intermediate_OOP]() - (coming soon) This is a great place to go if you already have some OOP knowledge and want to dive into some more complicated examples.
- [Practice_files](https://github.com/MissMeg/oop-practice/tree/master/practice_files) - These are python files you can use to run the examples from the guides on your own system.

## Requests to Add or Update Content

If you want to add to this repo or update content, please create a pull request and detail what you are adding or updating and why. I welcome any help to create a simple OOP guide for beginners. When writing your additions or updates, think about how you would describe a topic or snippet of code to a beginning developer or even a non-developer. This will help to keep the voice and language the same across the entire guide.
